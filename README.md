1. Problem Statement
Context: Samsung Finance operates across multiple global markets, serving diverse customer segments (Government, Enterprise, Midmarket, etc.) with a wide product portfolio. The Problem: The finance and sales teams struggle to consolidate data from disparate regions and timeframes. They lack a unified view to instantly assess which segments are driving profitability versus those that are driving volume but dragging down margins due to high Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). They need a central tool to monitor financial health, track seasonal trends, and filter performance by specific dates and demographics.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks the following high-level metrics:
Total Sales: The aggregate revenue generated ($118.73M).
Total Profit: The net earnings after costs ($16.89M).
Total Units Sold: The volume of product movement (1.13M).
Gross Sales by Segment: Revenue distribution across customer types (Government, Enterprise, etc.).
Profit by Segment: Profit contribution by customer type.
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): Direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold, tracked monthly.

3. Benefits & Outcomes
Segment Profitability Analysis: The dashboard reveals a critical insight: Government clients make up ~44% of Sales but contribute ~65% of Total Profit. This suggests the Government segment has much higher margins than others.
Seasonality Tracking: The monthly bar chart clearly highlights October as the peak month for activity, with a massive spike in both COGS ($18.2M) and Profit ($3.4M). This allows supply chain teams to prepare inventory for Q4 spikes.
Trend Identification: The "Units Sold by Quarter" line chart shows a sharp upward trajectory in Q4, indicating strong year-end performance.

4. Strengths
Effective Segmentation: By splitting "Sales by Segment" and "Profit by Segment" into two side-by-side donut charts, the dashboard allows for an immediate comparison between volume and value.
Comprehensive Filtering: The left sidebar (Slicer panel) is excellent. It allows users to drill down from a high level (Country) to a granular level (Day), which is essential for root-cause analysis.
Clear Headliners: The "BANs" (Big Area Numbers) at the top are distinct and immediately answer the "How are we doing?" question.
